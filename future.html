      <p class="text">
        For my post-secondary education ( college / university ), I plan on going into the technological field with a degree in Computer Science. I plan on getting a job as a software engineer and becoming someone others can look up to as successful.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        As a child I grew to learn how to code in HTML, CSS, and I learnt some basic JavaScript(JS). I grew to love coding and I would like to base my future around this. If I become successful in the field I end up choosing, I would like to become a mentor to someone else, so that they can learn and understand computer science and that one day they too can become a mentor to others.
