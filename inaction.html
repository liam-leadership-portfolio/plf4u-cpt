          When the class did the 'Running a Tournament' assignment, I chose to make a hybrid of soccer and bowling. I think that it wasn't a good tournament; as although I had everything planned out, I still panicked a lot when the tournament was in action. Even though I planned everything thoroughly, when the time came to speak to everyone and to explain, I made some mistakes and led the whole thing downhill.
          <br><br>
          I had planned out the tournament as a single elimination tournament but instead I had it played like a Round Robin tournament instead, where I had the losers versing against each other. Originally, I had planned for there to be no teams, but I couldn't figure out how to plan the tournament with a weird number of people there for a single elimination tournament, so I put them into teams.
