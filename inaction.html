          When the class did the 'Running a Tournament' assignment, I chose to make a hybrid of soccer and bowling. I think that it wasn't a good tournament; as although I had everything planned out, I still panicked a lot when the tournament was in action. Even though I planned everything thoroughly, when the time came to speak to everyone and to explain, I made some mistakes and led the whole thing downhill.
          <br><br>
          I had planned out the tournament as a single elimination tournament but instead I had it played like a Round Robin tournament instead, where I had the losers versing against each other. Originally, I had planned for there to be no teams, but I couldn't figure out how to plan the tournament with a weird number of people there for a single elimination tournament, so I put them into teams.
          <br><br>
          Overall, I think that depite that the tournament ran relatively smoothly, the satisfaction of the players were not high. I would rate the running of my tournament at a 4/10 overall.

          Communicating a Skill

        <p class="text">
          For the 'Communicating a Skill' assignment, I taught the class the basics of touch typing. I think I taught the skill well as I everyone understood how to type and I think it was something new to most people as well. I chose to teach touch typing as it is a vital skill if you want to learn how to type faster and more accurate, which is good if you want to get a job in the corporate world.
